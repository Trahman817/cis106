## What is an Operating System?
An Operating System is system software that acts as an interface between computer hardware and the user. It manages hardware resources and provides common services for computer programs.
## What is a kernel?
A kernel is the core part of an operating system. It directly interacts with the hardware and manages system resources such as CPU, memory, and device I/O. It operates in a privileged mode called kernel mode.
## Which other parts aside from the kernel identify an OS?

Aside from the kernel, an OS includes:
Shell: Interface for user commands (CLI or GUI).
System libraries: Provide standard functions for programs.
system utilities: Tools for managing files, processes, and settings.
Device drivers: Facilitate communication between hardware and software.

## What is linux and linux distribution?
Linux is an open-source, Unix-like operating system kernel created by Linus Torvalds in 1991.

A Linux Distribution (distro) is a complete OS package that includes the Linux kernel, software tools, package managers, and other components. Examples: Ubuntu, Fedora, Debian.

## What is virtualization?
irtualization is the process of creating virtual versions of computing resources such as operating systems, servers, storage devices, or networks. It allows multiple virtual machines (VMs) to run on a single physical machine.

Types include:
Hardware virtualization (e.g., VMs using VirtualBox or VMware)
operating system-level virtualization (e.g., containers like Docker)
